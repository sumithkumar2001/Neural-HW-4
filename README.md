# ðŸ§  Natural Language Processing Basics

This repository contains 4 beginner-friendly Python scripts that demonstrate core concepts in Natural Language Processing (NLP). These examples use popular libraries like NLTK, spaCy, and NumPy to show how text can be processed and analyzedâ€”from simple preprocessing to named entity recognition and attention mechanisms.

## ðŸ“„ Overview of Files

### âœ… Code 1: Text Preprocessing with NLTK

**File**: `code1_nltk_preprocessing.py`

**Description**:
Performs basic NLP preprocessing on a sentence using NLTK.

**Steps Covered**:
- Tokenization using regular expressions
- Removal of English stopwords
- Word stemming using the Porter Stemmer

**Usage**:
```bash
pip install nltk
```
Run the script and you'll see outputs for tokens, filtered tokens, and stemmed words.

---

### âœ… Code 2: Named Entity Recognition with spaCy

**File**: `code2_spacy_ner.py`

**Description**:
Uses spaCyâ€™s `en_core_web_sm` model to identify named entities like people, dates, and places.

**Steps Covered**:
- Load spaCy NLP pipeline
- Process a sentence
- Print all detected named entities and metadata (label, position)

**Usage**:
```bash
pip install spacy
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```
Run the script to see extracted named entities with their labels.

### âœ… Code 3: Scaled Dot-Product Attention using NumPy (v1)

**File**: `code3_attention_numpy.py`

**Description**:
Implements the scaled dot-product attention mechanism (used in Transformers) from scratch using NumPy.

**Concepts Demonstrated**:
- Matrix multiplication for query-key attention
- Softmax for attention scores
- Scaled attention output

**Dependencies**:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

**Included Test Case**:
```python
Q = [[1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1]]
K = [[1, 0, 1, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1]]
V = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]]
```

---

### âœ… Code 4: Scaled Dot-Product Attention using NumPy (v2)

**File**: `code4_attention_numpy_duplicate.py`

**Note**: This is a duplicate of Code 3 and performs the same operations.

**Purpose**: Can be used as a sandbox or backup copy for experiments or slight modifications.
